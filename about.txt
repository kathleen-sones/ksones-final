Nick & Aina Barber own & operate Barber Signs, and have been in business for over 20 years.Nick is a graduate of The Chicago Academy of Fine Arts with a degree in Cartooning. Yes, they give degrees for it! After doing caricatures at Magic Mountain for five years, Nick applied his talents to retail windows for the holidays. Pretty soon the customers were asking for signs all year.Matriculating in the school of experience, Aina has an extensive sales/marketing/administrative background and keeps things running smoothly.Our client list today is diverse. Ranging from local one-store operations to nationwide chains or small restaurant windows to huge auto showrooms. We travel  to any area, as we did for Taco Bell, processing an ad campaign for 38 locations in five states.We have window backgrounds in the Alan Jackson music video Summertime Blues and television commercials for Aetna and Isuzu. You may have seen one of our windows, though fleetingly, in the Nike award winning Morning After (Y2K) commercial, which ran during the big Y2K scare.Our book "How to Paint Water Color Window Splashes".we are happy to say, has been a big success and we are working on our next one, Advanced Techniques for  Window Splashes.We also write articles about window splashes for SignCraft Magazine a couple of times a year.
