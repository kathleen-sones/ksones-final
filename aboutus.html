<h2>ABOUT US</h2>
<h1>Get to know us...</h1>
<p>Nick and Aina Barber own and operate Barber Signs, and have been in business for over 20 years.</p>

<p>Nick is a graduate of The Chicago Academy of Fine Arts with a degree in Cartooning. Yes, they give degrees for it! After doing caricatures at Magic Mountain for five years, Nick applied his talents to retail windows for the holidays. Pretty soon the customers were asking for signs all year.</p>

<p>Matriculating in the school of experience, Aina has an extensive sales/marketing/administrative background and keeps things running smoothly.</p>

<p>Our client list today is diverse. Ranging from local one-store operations to nationwide chains or small restaurant windows to huge auto showrooms. We travel to any area, as we did for Taco Bell, processing an ad campaign for 38 locations in five states.</p>

<p>We are happy to say that our book "How to Paint Water Color Window Splashes" has been a big success and we are working on our next one, "Advanced Techniques for Window Splashes." We also write articles about window splashes for SignCraft Magazine a couple of times a year.</p>
